# A-star(-ish) pathfinder
this is one of if not the first things I coded

## backstory
I started coding a few years ago for my A-level. I had almost no prior experience in coding and what I did have was scratch. After 2 weeks of background my teacher siad me and the other inexperienced students could code something called the "monster game" (a turn based dungeon crawler printed with letters in the terminal (see the "monter.py" file)) After a day I had the game and some levels coded (this was before I knew how to use files properly) and with the teacher wanting us to spend another week on it to get the basics I turned to making the opponent more advanced. That is how I developed the pathfinder and then the A-star pathfinder. I then took the pathfinder and put it in a grid generator to show how it works.
